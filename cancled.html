        <h1>Why was the Trello page cancled</h1>
        <p>The Trello page was cancled because Khattab wanted to make things a surprise of what happens next, and he wants to reacive bugs that people find so he can feel that people are seeing what is wrong and good in the website so he can make the people happy. If this explination was not well enough then contact Khattab on Twitter</p>
